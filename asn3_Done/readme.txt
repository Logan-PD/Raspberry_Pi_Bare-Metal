The only code that was written for this assigment was 'main.c' and 'handlers.c'.

These two files were largely based off of the examples done in turorials and shown in lecture,
by Dr. Boyd and Dr. Manzara. The other files are from 'minimalInterruptexample' and 'systemtimerdelay'.

To run the program, open a terminal in the folder containing all submitted files, and run 'make all'.
Put the 'kernel.img' file onto the rasberry pi along with the 'bootcode.bin', 'fixup.dat' and 'start.elf' file. 
Power up the pi.
